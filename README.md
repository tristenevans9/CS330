# How do I approach desiging software?
When designing software with regards to computer graphics, it is important to set realistic expectations and determine
the set of skills that will be required to achieve them. Along with that, having a detailed inspirational photo to draw
from. From there, you can determine that types of shapes, textures, and lighting that you will need to complete the 
scenary.

# How do I approach developing programs?
Since this course was my first time working with any computer graphics, I heavily relied on studying the parts of the 
program that were already coded. After reviewing the material, I was able to see how the program's different methods
worked together to create the scenary. After that, I was able to replicate the needed code to create the scene that I 
wanted. Within this project, you can see that the code can become very repetitive and easy to read through.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer graphics is an important sector within the computer science field. I knew that at some point in my career I 
would work with computer graphics so I am glad I was able to start learning it now. This course was able to lay the 
foundation for everything further to be laid upon.
